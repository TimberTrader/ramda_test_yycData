# extension of everythingCalgary
This project has the ultimate goal of producing a new summary dataset drawn from The City of Calgary's 'Property Assesesments' dataset through the Open Calgary data portal.
You will find a demosntartion of my dev skillset which will utlimately include:
* working with large amounts of data - the Property Assessments dataset contains the value of all the property tax assessments for the years 20065 through 2019 inclusive representing 6,570,000 records.
* working with Ramda, a practical functional library for JavaScript programmers - elegantly and efficiently manipulate the data objects to produce a new data object that will contain the minimum, third quartile average, median average , 1st quartile average and maximum values of the residential property tax assesments for each of the 200+ Calgary communities which have residential properties and for each of the 15 years taht exist in the original dataset.
* working with JS Charts (or similar) library to produce represenations of the data that will allow users to view the summarry data by community over time and by comparison to other communities.
* working with Node.js and Vue.js to create a simple website.
* working with AWS to deploy the website.
